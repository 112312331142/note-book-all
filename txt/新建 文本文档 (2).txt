立春(Start of Spring)在中国农历中表示春天的开始。立春之后，白天变得更长，天气也愈发温暖: 万物开始复苏，大地充满生机。人们常说“一年之计在于春”，农民在这个时节开始播种，为全年的丰收打下基础。中国人早在三千年前就已开始在立春这一天举行庆祝活动。数百年来，迎春一直是民间的重要习俗。在春暖花开的日子里，人们常常外出玩，欣赏春天的美景。

　　Start of Spring means the beginning of spring in the Chinese lunar calendar. After the Start of Spring, the days get longer and the weather gets warmer: everything starts to recover and the earth is full of life. It is often said that "a year's plan begins in spring". Farmers start planting seeds at this time to lay the foundation for the whole year's harvest. As early as 3,000 years ago, Chinese people began to celebrate the Start of Spring on this day. Welcoming spring has been an important folk custom for hundreds of years. In the spring days, people often go out to play and enjoy the beautiful scenery in spring.

　冬至是全年白昼最长，黑夜最短的一天，标志着一年中最寒冷时节的开始。冬至过后，气温越来越低，人们户外活动逐渐减少，农民地里的活不多，主要忙于灌溉系统的维护和主要农作物的防冻，同时为来年春天播种做准备。中国人历年来很重视冬至，许多地方都把冬至当作一个节日，庆祝方式不尽相同，北方人有冬至吃饺子的习俗，南方人有冬至吃汤圆的传统。

　　The winter solstice is the day with the longest days and shortest nights of the whole year, marking the beginning of the coldest time of the year. After the winter solstice, the temperature gets colder and people's outdoor activities gradually decrease. Farmers are not doing much work in the fields and are mainly busy with the maintenance of irrigation systems and freeze protection for major crops, while preparing for planting in the coming spring. The Chinese have attached great importance to the winter solstice for many years. Many places regard the winter solstice as a festival, and the way to celebrate it is different. People in the north have the custom of eating dumplings, while people in the south have the tradition of eating sweet dumplings.
